# Visualising-Twitter-Data
#
Phase 1: Use tweepy to gain a critical mass of tweets regarding a chosen topic and annotate the sentiment of the tweets; positive, negative, neutral.
    - Clean and organise the data, remove duplicates and use techniques from text classification exercise such as stopping and stemming to prepare the dataset.

Phase 2: Create a model which can accurately assign a  polarity to a group of new tweets within the chosen topic. Test your model against a different domain eg politics model on sports or tech.

Deliverables

1. A dataset with annotated training data for sentiment polarity
2. A model which predicts polarity of given tweet
3. A report which includes a comparison with VADER(an off the shelf sentiment analysis tool)
